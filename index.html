    Brilliant students of Gyanodaya’s Students Gyanodaya Secondary School of Bafal always comes first in everything. Students of the computer section of Gyanodaya have to submit one project in a year to their computer teacher (Er. Mannor Shakhya). The students made a project called (Obstacle Avoiding Robot) to skip their classes. At that time, a science demonstration program was organized in Gyanodaya, in which the same students were the first and won the first place. And they were sent to perform in STAN’s demonstration program Later, students of Gyanodaya won first place in a competition between schools with about 40 schools in that competition. Along with this, Gyanodaya was competing with other municipalities from Kathmandu municipality. The students not only represented their college but their Municipality also made their cars bluetooth-enabled to compete with other municipalities. Now the car can be driven from our mobile and in auto mode. Gyanodaya also won the first place in the competition under the municipality. After winning from the municipality, now the students of Gyanodaya were representing Kathmandu municipality and now they were in the district competition. The competition was very tough. There was close competition between them and the students of Budhanilkantha municipality. When the students were representing the Kathmandu municipality in the district, they named their car Gyani Rover, as Gyani represented Gyanodaya, while Rover stood for remotely operated vehicle. At first, the car was named Tesla Yatayat(i.e in the Gyanodaya science demonstration program). When the students go to the district, it could read the level of LPG gas at home, they have the feature to receive calls when the level exceeds, and they have the feature to know the temperature and humidity of the house or the environment. After all this could be done, Gyanodaya (i.e. Kathmandu municipality) took the first place in the district. Yes, it is very good to know if there is a gas leak in the house.  Students progress was also shown in the Routine Of Nepal Banda(RONB) In this way, in the MechTRIX-2079 (college level) science exhibition program held at Pulchowk Engineering Campus, Gyanodaya S.S The students won second place there however the points between 1st and 2nd was just 2.">
